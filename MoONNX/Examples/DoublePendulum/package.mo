<p>This collection of examples demonstrates the dynamic behavior of a double pendulum controlled by a neural network, implemented in Modelica using the MoONNX Library. The examples showcase various aspects of neural network-based control strategies. Features include manual triggering, normalized inputs, and interactive user control. Each example highlights techniques for stabilizing the chaotic dynamics of the double pendulum and allows testing under diverse conditions, such as the application of external forces.</p>
